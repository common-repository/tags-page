Adds a table listing all tags registered on your website.

== Description ==

Standard installation of WordPress provides tags for posts and also Tag Cloud widget for 45 most common tags. Unfortunatelly there is no option to offer your web visitors list of all tags. And that is purpose of this plugin.

This plugin adds a link to the bottom of the Tag Cloud widget, which leads to a page displaying table of all tags from the website. This table consists of two columns, in the first one you find tag name, which also serves as a link to the articles tagged in it. The second column contains count, how many times the tag is used. The table is sortable by both columns, just by clicking on the header of the column. Sorting is provided by JavaScript, so no reloading of page.

== Installation ==

1.	Upload the full directory to wp-content/plugins
2.	Activate plugin Tags Page in plugins administration
3.	Make sure you are having the Tags Cloud widget on your website
4.	Enjoy!
5.	For detailed customization, please see the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/tags-page/faq/">FAQ</a> section

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Plugin registers new shortcode <code>[get_tags]</code>, which generates the table with all tags. You can use this shortcode on a page or in a post, if you wish.

The shortcode supports pagination via optional attribute pagesize; if set to an integer value, the table will be split into pages containing the specified amount of tags (lines), with listing through pages below the table. If the attribute pagesize is omited, then a full table with all tags is displayed, without any pagination. To utilize pagination, to specify it in the shortcode, you need to display the table on a real page, not virtual -- please see below.

Example: <code>[get_tags pagesize="100"]</code>

When you activate the plugin, it will display the table with all tags on a virtual page, which it will generate on fly, when needed. The virtual page can have any URI (located within your installation of WordPress) -- simply what is configured in the widget settings, this will become the address of the virtual page. The virtual page contains only the table generated by the <code>[get_tags]</code> shortcode, nothing else; the title of the page is All Tags. The templates used to generate the virtual page are (within your theme) in the following priority:

<ol><li><em>page-tags-page.php</em></li>
<li><em>page.php</em></li></ol>

If you wish, you can use a real page instead of the virtual one. Just create a page, put the shortcode <code>[get_tags]</code> into the content, optionally add the pagesize attribute or any other content; in the Tag Cloud widget configuration, set the URL of the link to lead to this real page.

Graphical style of the table is fully managed by CSS (cascade style sheets), so you can easily override the default lookout just by your own CSS values after calling <code>wp_head();</code> in your theme header.
